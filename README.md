## Code Structure
### HTML files
I have stored all of my HTML5 files at the directory level

### Assets folder
All files complimenting my HTML have been included in the assets folder. Broken down by:
- css
- images
- js

### README file
The README file is also at directory level and the assosciated files are stored in a "media" folder

### Media Folder
The Media folder contains all of the images used in the README file

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

#### Visitor Goals
- A place to test knowledge gained in preparation for exams 
- Test themselves on different subjects

## Design
### Colour Scheme
I decided to use orange colours as they are bright and could help keep the user engaged. Throughout the whole app there are different shades of orange.

#### Colours used:
- color1: rgb(255, 136, 0)
- color2: rgb(255, 63, 5)
- color3: rgb(255, 105, 5)
- color4: rgb(255, 90, 5)
- color5: rgb(255, 119, 28)
- progress: rgba(255, 63, 5, 0.568) *(used for the progress bar)* 
- correct: rgb(39,161,67) *(used for the correct answer)*
- incorrect: rgb(220,53,69) *(used for the incorrect answer)*
